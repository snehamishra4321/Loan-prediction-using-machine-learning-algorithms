### Loan-prediction-using-machine-learning-algorithms
- Designed a predictive model using logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest. Extracted insights from the dataset using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.
- This project involves using machine learning algorithms to predict loan default. 
- The goal of the project is to use a variety of data sets and algorithms to develop a model that can accurately predict whether or not a borrower will default on a loan. 
- The data sets could includes information about the borrower such as credit score, income, employment history, and other financial data. 
- The algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest for optimum results. 
- The model is then be tested to determine its accuracy in predicting loan defaults. 
- The results of the project could help banks and other lenders improve their loan approval processes and reduce their risk of default.
